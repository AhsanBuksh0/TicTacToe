**Tic-Tac-Toe User Manual**

# 1. Introduction:
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. This user manual provides instructions on how to play the graphical version of Tic-Tac-Toe created using Python and tkinter.

# 2. Installation:
The Tic-Tac-Toe game does not require any installation process. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/

# 3. Starting the Game:
To start the game, run the Python script containing the Tic-Tac-Toe code. The graphical interface of the game will appear on your screen.

# 4. Game Interface:
The game interface consists of a 3x3 grid of buttons. Each button represents a cell in the Tic-Tac-Toe grid. Players can click on the buttons to make their moves.

# 5. Gameplay:
When the game starts, Player 1 (X) will be the first to move.
Players take turns clicking on an empty cell to place their mark (X or O) on the grid.
The game will automatically switch turns between X and O after each valid move.
The game will display a message box if a player wins or if the game ends in a draw.
To restart the game after a win or draw, simply close the message box. The grid will be cleared, and a new game will start automatically.

# 6. Winning the Game:
A player wins the game if they have three of their marks (X or O) in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. The game will display a message box announcing the winner.

# 7. Ending the Game:
The game can be ended in the following ways:
Player Wins: If a player successfully forms a row of three of their marks, they are declared the winner.
Draw: If all cells are filled, and no player has formed a winning row, the game ends in a draw.
8. Exiting the Game:
To exit the game, simply close the game window.

#9.Troubleshooting:
If the game window freezes or becomes unresponsive, you can close the window and restart the game by running the Python script again.
Ensure that you are clicking only on the empty cells. Clicking on a cell that already contains a mark will result in an invalid move.
Enjoy playing Tic-Tac-Toe! Have fun and challenge your friends to see who can win the most rounds of this classic game!
